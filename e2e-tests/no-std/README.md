# Testing `arithmetic-*` Crates in `no_std` Env

This simple crate tests that `arithmetic-parser` / `arithmetic-eval` crates build
and can be used in a `no_std` environment (namely, an [ARM Cortex-M3] microcontroller).
It requires a nightly toolchain. The `release` profile must be used
to not overflow the available microcontroller flash memory.

## Usage

Beside using a real microcontroller, the crate can be tested with [qemu].
In fact, Cargo is configured to run qemu when using `cargo run`.

1. Install a recent nightly Rust toolchain and the `thumbv7m-none-eabi` target
   for it.
2. Install qemu. In Linux, qemu is often included as a system package, so
   this step can be as simple as `sudo apt-get install qemu-system-arm`.
3. Compile and run the app on qemu using `cd $crate_dir && cargo run --release`,
   where `$crate_dir` is the directory containing this README.
   Switching to the crate directory is necessary to use the [Cargo config](.cargo/config.toml),
   which sets up necessary `rustc` flags and the qemu wrapper for `cargo run`.
