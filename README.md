This repository contains a versatile parser for arithmetic expressions
which allows customizing literal definitions, type annotations and several other aspects of parsing.
The repository also contains several auxiliary crates (for example, a simple interpreter). 

## Contents

- [`arithmetic-parser`](parser) is the core parsing library.
- [`arithmetic-eval`](eval) is a simple interpreter, which could be used on parsed expressions
  in *some* cases. See the crate docs for more details on its limitations.
- [`arithmetic-typing`](typing) is Hindleyâ€“Milner type inference for parsed expressions.
- [`arithmetic-parser-cli`](cli) is the CLI / REPL for the library.
