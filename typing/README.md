Hindleyâ€“Milner type inference for arithmetic expressions parsed
by the [`arithmetic-parser`] crate.

This crate allows parsing type annotations as a part of grammars, and to infer
and check types for expressions / statements produced by `arithmetic-parser`.
Type inference is *partially* compatible with the interpreter from [`arithmetic-eval`];
if the inference algorithm succeeds on a certain expression / statement / block,
it will execute successfully, but not all successfully executing items pass type inference.

## Usage

Add this to your `Crate.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
arithmetic-typing = "0.2.0"
```

Please see the crate docs and [examples](examples) for the examples of usage.
